## String Manipulation Poker (Created May 2020)
Poker game in C# that uses string manipulation and methods to play poker against an opponent. This game is very similar to real life poker, but without the money being spent! 

## The Rules
- You will start off with *100 pucks* (poker bucks) and are given two cards from the deck. 
- You are facing off with a random opponent who starts with two different cards than you.
  - opponents include: (:|) Bob, (:V) Kathy, (:C) Desdemona, (:D) Sunny, and (:{) Barnaby
  - They all have a poker face, so watch out!
- Your opponent will go first and will either fold his/her cards or bet some pucks. 
- If your opponent chooses to bet, then it will be your turn. 
- You have the choice to match, raise, or fold. 
- If you ***match***, you will match the bet your opponent made. 
- If you choose to ***raise***, you can choose the amount you want to raise. 
- If you choose to ***fold***, you will have the option to either continue the game (with the same number of pucks), or quit the match. 
- Whoever had the best hand will win the round (the hands from worst to best in this game are: **High Card, Pair, Two Pair, Three of a Kind, Flush, Full House, Four of a Kind, Royal Flush**). 
- The only time you can see your opponent's cards is if you or they bet all in and at the end of the game before the winner is announced.
- The game will continue until either of you have bet all in and lost all your pucks, but you have the option to quit at the end of every round.

This was my first major project that I ever coded in any language, so I hope you enjoy it!
